## Project Focus
The focus of this exercise was to implement a simple, React-based Client Manager application. The reasoning behind using React.js was to take advantage of its efficient DOM manipulation and component-based architecture, which allows for a clean, organized codebase. The core functionalities of the application include creating a new client, specifying their details (including name, DOB, contact info, and status), viewing all clients, and the ability to filter clients by their status.

## Project Explanation
This application is a simple client management system where users can add new clients with specific details (first name, last name, date of birth, email, address, and status), view all clients, and filter clients based on their status (new, active, or inactive). 

The application is built with React and uses React's built-in state management to handle the application's state.

## How to Run

Make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) installed in your system. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application. The application will open in your default web browser.

Please note, this is a basic front-end application and doesn't persist data. Any data you add will be lost upon refreshing the page.

## Feedback
Building this application was straightforward as the requirements were clear. However, the project can be expanded to include more features like data persistence, client update, and delete functionality. Furthermore, it could also benefit from some UI/UX improvements for a better user experience.

## Future Improvements and Additions

If more time was provided, the following changes and additions could be made:

1. **Data Persistence**: Implementing a back-end database to store client data permanently. This could be done using a simple Express server and MongoDB for the database.
2. **Client Update Functionality**: Adding the ability for users to update client data.
3. **Client Delete Functionality**: Adding the ability for users to remove clients from the list.
4. **Authentication**: Implementing user authentication, so each user has access to their specific client data.
5. **Search Functionality**: Adding a search bar for users to quickly find clients by name.
6. **Sort Functionality**: Allow users to sort clients by name, date added, etc.
7. **Testing**: Add unit and integration testing to ensure the application works correctly as it is developed.
8. **UI/UX improvements**: Enhance the design and usability of the application for a better user experience. 
9. **Deployment**: Deploy the application so it's accessible online for users.
